## 2026-04-13 — Repo bootstrap

**Accomplishments:**
- Cloned empty `Jlabarca/represent` repo
- Wrote `docs/DOCS-PROTOCOL.md` (adapted from ORO DOCS-PROTOCOL.md + Notion Bootstrap Architect doctrine)
- Scaffolded root living docs: `CONTEXT.md`, `TODO.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `LOGBOOK.md`, `README.md`
- Seeded `BACKLOG.md` with visual-mode ideas migrated from the Notion workspace (creature, city, actor, blueprint, gource, neopet)

**Decisions:**
- Repo is the new home for the doctrine; the Notion workspace remains as the historical idea trail (Rule 5: Append & Deprecate — nothing deleted).
- Rule 6 (Atomic POC Structure) is mandatory for every `research/` entry: System Intent, Ingestion Vector, Visualization Spec, Bootstrapping Steps.
- Rule 8 (Directory Tree Standard) adds `@LLM-ENTRY`, `@LLM-TARGET`, `@LLM-DECORATIVE`, `@LLM-IGNORE` annotations.

**Blockers:** None.

**Next steps:**
- Pick the inaugural visual mode and write the first `research/{mode}.md` POC brief.
- Decide the v0 ingestion strategy.

## 2026-10-21 — Represent v0 bootstrap and reference study

**Accomplishments:**
- Copied and read the 18-page Interactive Atlas PDF under `research/sources/`.
- Read the prepared kickoff, original vision/presence proposals, graphify results and methrep contract/emitters.
- Bootstrapped `REPRESENT-V0-IMPL.md` with P0-P4, evidence gates, source scope and auto-resolved questions. Started reference and companion research.

**Decisions:**
- Follow the operator's research-first sequence: clone, study/use, synthesize, design, build.
- Preserve headless/Ghost-only commitments and the scene/events boundary; evaluate language and renderer against actual reference code.
- Include JavaScript in P1; plane-sync has 19 tracked files and belongs in the small target tier.
- Use branch `codex/represent-v0`; keep pre-existing methodology rollout changes outside task commits.

**Blockers:** None for research. Browser/runtime availability and reference execution limits will be recorded as evidence, not assumed successful.

**Next steps:** Finish reference trials/synthesis, record P0 decisions, then produce the first plane-sync scene before P2-P4.
